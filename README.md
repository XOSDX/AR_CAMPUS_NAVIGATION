Project Title:
This is an interactive application of campus navigation enabling the potential and actual student to get real life experience in the environment they need to be familiar with as they study at the university.

Abstract:
The AR Campus Navigation project is based on AR, which provides real time directions and guidance interlinked with the traditional models of campus navigation. The application then procedurally builds on real environments by using features such as Unity’s AR Foundation and XR Plugin Management for the occurrence of virtual elements on real-life settings through the use of a smartphone’s screen. They make the interaction more natural as 토 the program adapts to real life points of interest , give clear leads about possible actions, and generally enrich the user experience.

Key Features:
Interactive AR Navigation: Navigational signs in the form of chevrons, icons which read in English and have been translated in over 100 languages, and simultaneouently spoken directions that change depending on the user’s position.

Technology Stack: 
Unity 3D in combination with AR Foundation, ARCore/ ARKit and XR Plugin Management.

Custom Scripts: 
Such as image tag tracking, navigation and dynamic placing of indicator arrows.

Device Compatibility: 
Works for both iOS and Android operating systems.

User-Centric Design: 
It makes Web content more accessible for a wide variety of users including disabled people with poor eyesight.

Methodology

Initial Setup:
Installed Android SDK and some of the XR plugins.
Unity setup in order to develop for AR.

Scene Configuration:
Implementing a replacement of default components by an AR Camera.
Directing the environment to correspond with those of the campus such as getting familiar with 3D settings.

Feature Integration:
For real time image recognition use AR Tracked Image Manager.
An exploration of how to set up natural routes by using Line Renderer.

Development:
Automating the basic navigation logic and instantiation of full body avatars using prefabs for structure.
Testing and Deployment:
Implementation of testing running on IP connections on real devices.
Final validation test to be done internally in our campuses.

Technologies Used
Unity Hub 
Unity Editor [Unity 6000]
Unity 3D: Core development platform.

AR Foundation: Programmable AR interface that supports cross-platform application.

XR Plugin Management: For ARCore & ARKit feature.

Programming Languages: C# for scripting.

Future Enhancements
Interconnection of voice commands.
Real time environment accommodation.
Expand the system for specific to large or more complicated organizations.
